Import the EnemyIcons pictures into your project into the \"pictures\" folder. \r\nOpen the text file containing the script and copy/paste it into the script editor below all of the default scripts but above Main. \r\n \r\nFAQ  \r\nQ. Can this do __________?  \r\nA. Maybe! Leave on post on the forum, and I might just add the feature if it can't already do it. \r\n  \r\nCredits and Thanks  \r\n- MobiusXVI, author  \r\n- TheRiotInside, for testing/feedback/suggestions  \r\n- Mudkicker, for suggesting customizable turn icons  \r\n \r\nLicense  \r\nThis script is licensed under the MIT license, so you can use it for both commercial and non-commercial games!  \r\nCheck the included license file for the full text.  \r\nFurther, if you do decide to use this script in a commercial product, I'd ask that you   \r\nlet me know via a forum post or a PM.
