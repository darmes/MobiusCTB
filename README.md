Release Notes  
v. 1.0    Initial Release  
v. 1.1    Customizable Turn Icons  
 
Introduction  
This script overhauls the default battle system and replaces it with a "CTB" system similar to Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy X. 
Battlers now use their speed to charge up a hidden turn gauge, and when it's full, they get a turn immediately. 
This causes turns to alternate in a semi-predictable order, making for a more strategic battle system. 
 
Features  
- Customizable "charge rate" formula: you can use any stat to determine turn order and adjust it to fit your experience curve 
- Dedicated turn window so you'll always know whose turn is next. 
- Weapons/Skills/Items can be set to boost/hamper speed when used, allowing you to create "quick attack" skills that let the user act sooner or "mega-death" skills that use up two turns. 
- Designate specific enemies as "bosses" which will give them a special icon. 
- Can customize turn icons on a per actor or per enemy basis. 
- Customize the "escape" term. 
- Built-in "scan" skill that's easy to set up and use. 
- Optional expansion to add icons for states, removing the boring state text. 
 
How to Use  
Download the zip file. Import the EnemyIcons pictures into your project into the "pictures" folder. 
Open the text file containing the script and copy/paste it into the script editor below all of the default scripts but above Main. 
 
FAQ
